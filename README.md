# MapViewerGL

A modern web-based map viewer that supports multiple data formats and interactive visualization.

üåç [Live Demo](https://bobsa514.github.io/mapviewer-gl/)

## Important Notes

### Data Storage
- **No Data Storage**: Please note that this tool does not store any data on the server. All data processing occurs locally on the user's machine. Once the session is closed, any uploaded data will be lost. This design ensures user privacy and data security.

### Mapbox Token
- **Environment Configuration**: It is REQUIRED to change the `.env` file in your project directory to include your own Mapbox token. The demo token included has strict usage limits and may stop working if exceeded.
- **Token Requirements**: 
  - Sign up for a free account at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/)
  - Create a new public token in your account
  - The free tier includes 50,000 map loads per month
  - The map will stop working if this limit is exceeded
- **Usage Limits**:
  - The free Mapbox tier has a limit of 50,000 map loads per month
  - Once this limit is reached, the map will stop loading for new users
  - The limit resets at the start of each billing cycle
  - Consider using the free CartoDB basemaps ("Light", "Dark", "City") which don't have these restrictions
- To set your token, open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your own Mapbox access token:
  ```plaintext
  VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
  ```
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mapviewer-gl.git
cd mapviewer-gl
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your Mapbox token to the `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process uses GitHub Actions and securely injects the Mapbox token from GitHub Secrets.

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`: Your Mapbox GL JS access token (required)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Update the `.env` file with your Mapbox token.
4. Run the application using `npm run dev`.
5. Deploy the application using `npm run deploy`.
